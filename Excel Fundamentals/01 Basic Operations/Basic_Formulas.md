# Basic Formulas in Excel

## Overview
Basic formulas are essential for quick calculations in Excel. This guide covers SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and COUNT with examples.

## Key Formulas
- **SUM**: `=SUM(A1:A10)` – Adds values in a range.
- **AVERAGE**: `=AVERAGE(A1:A10)` – Calculates mean of a range.
- **MIN**: `=MIN(A1:A10)` – Finds smallest value.
- **MAX**: `=MAX(A1:A10)` – Finds largest value.
- **COUNT**: `=COUNT(A1:A10)` – Counts cells with numbers.

## Step-by-Step Example
**Scenario**: Analyze monthly sales data in cells A2:A13.
1. **Total Sales**:
   - In cell A14, enter `=SUM(A2:A13)` to sum sales.
2. **Average Sales**:
   - In cell A15, enter `=AVERAGE(A2:A13)` to find the mean.
3. **Min and Max**:
   - In A16, enter `=MIN(A2:A13)` for lowest sales.
   - In A17, enter `=MAX(A2:A13)` for highest sales.
4. **Count Months**:
   - In A18, enter `=COUNT(A2:A13)` to count entries.

## Practical Scenario
You have a dataset with daily expenses in B2:B31. Calculate total expenses, average daily spend, min, max, and count of days with expenses.

## Practice Tasks
1. Sum sales for Q1 (3 months) in a dataset.
2. Find the average score of 20 students.
3. Identify the lowest and highest temperatures in a week’s data.
4. Count non-empty cells in a column with mixed data.
5. Combine formulas (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A10)/COUNT(A1:A10)` for manual average).

## Interview Tip
Interviewers often test basic formula accuracy. Practice entering formulas without errors and explaining their purpose.
