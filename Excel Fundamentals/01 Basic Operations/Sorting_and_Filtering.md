# Sorting and Filtering in Excel

## Overview
Sorting and filtering organize data for analysis. This guide covers sorting by values and filtering specific data.

## Key Concepts
- **Sorting** (Data > Sort):
  - A-Z or Z-A for text/numbers.
  - Custom sort by multiple columns (e.g., Region, then Sales).
- **Filtering** (Data > Filter):
  - Add filter arrows to headers.
  - Filter by values, text, or conditions (e.g., >100).
- **Clear Filters**: Data > Clear to show all data.

## Step-by-Step Example
**Scenario**: Sort and filter a sales table (columns: Region, Sales, Date).
1. **Sort by Sales**:
   - Select table (A1:C100).
   - Data > Sort > Sort by “Sales” > Largest to Smallest.
2. **Filter by Region**:
   - Data > Filter.
   - Click Region filter arrow, select “North”.
3. **Clear Filters**:
   - Data > Clear to reset.

## Practical Scenario
You have a dataset with employee names, departments, and salaries. Sort by salary (high to low) and filter for the IT department.

## Practice Tasks
1. Sort a dataset by product price (low to high).
2. Filter sales data to show values >$500.
3. Apply a custom sort by department, then by hire date.
4. Filter dates to show only 2025 entries.
5. Combine sort and filter to show top 10 sales in a region.

## Interview Tip
Interviewers may ask you to extract specific data. Practice filtering quickly and explaining your steps.
