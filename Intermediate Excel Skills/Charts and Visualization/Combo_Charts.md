# Combo Charts in Excel

## Overview
Combo Charts combine multiple chart types (e.g., column and line) to show different data series, ideal for interviews requiring multi-dimensional analysis.

## Key Concepts
- **Combo Chart**: Insert > Combo Chart.
- **Chart Types**: Combine column, line, or area charts.
- **Secondary Axis**: Use for different scales.
- **Customization**: Adjust titles, axes, and series.

## Step-by-Step Example
**Scenario**: Show sales and profit margin in one chart.
1. **Prepare Data**:
   - Columns: Month (A2:A13), Sales (B2:B13), Profit Margin % (C2:C13).
2. **Insert Combo Chart**:
   - Select A1:C13.
   - Insert > Combo Chart > Clustered Column - Line on Secondary Axis.
3. **Customize**:
   - Sales as columns, Profit Margin as line.
   - Add chart title: “Sales vs. Profit Margin”.
   - Enable Data Labels for clarity.

## Practical Scenario
You have revenue and growth rate data. Create a Combo Chart with revenue as columns and growth rate as a line on a secondary axis.

## Practice Tasks
1. Create a Combo Chart for sales and costs.
2. Use a secondary axis for percentage data.
3. Combine bar and area charts for two metrics.
4. Add data labels and customize colors.
5. Create a Combo Chart with three data series.

## Interview Tip
Interviewers may ask for multi-series visualizations. Practice explaining the relationship between charted metrics.
