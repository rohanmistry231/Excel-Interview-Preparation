# Grouping Data in Pivot Tables

## Overview
Grouping in Pivot Tables organizes data by dates or categories for better analysis.

## Key Concepts
- **Date Grouping**: Group by years, quarters, months.
- **Category Grouping**: Group text or numbers into custom ranges.
- **Ungroup**: Right-click > Ungroup to revert.

## Step-by-Step Example
**Scenario**: Group sales data by quarter and product type.
1. **Create Pivot Table**:
   - Data: Date (A), Product (B), Sales (C).
   - Insert Pivot Table with Date in Rows, Product in Columns, Sales in Values.
2. **Group by Quarter**:
   - Right-click a date in the Pivot Table > Group > Quarters.
3. **Group by Custom Category**:
   - Add a new column for Sales Range (e.g., High/Low).
   - Group by this column in the Pivot Table.

## Practical Scenario
You have sales data with dates and regions. Group by month and create custom groups for sales (<500, 500-1000, >1000).

## Practice Tasks
1. Group sales data by year and month.
2. Create custom groups for employee ages (e.g., 20-30, 31-40).
3. Group dates by quarters and years.
4. Ungroup and reapply different groupings.
5. Combine date and category grouping in one Pivot Table.

## Interview Tip
Interviewers may test data aggregation. Practice grouping and explaining summarized results.
