# What-If Analysis in Excel

## Overview
What-If Analysis, including Goal Seek and Scenario Manager, explores data outcomes, a key skill for interviews.

## Key Concepts
- **Goal Seek**: Data > What-If Analysis > Goal Seek.
  - Adjusts a variable to achieve a target value.
- **Scenario Manager**: Data > What-If Analysis > Scenario Manager.
  - Compares multiple input scenarios.

## Step-by-Step Example
**Scenario**: Find sales needed for a target profit.
1. **Goal Seek**:
   - Cell B1: Sales, B2: Cost, B3: Profit (`=B1-B2`).
   - Data > What-If Analysis > Goal Seek.
   - Set Cell: B3, To Value: 1000, By Changing Cell: B1.
2. **Scenario Manager**:
   - Data > What-If Analysis > Scenario Manager.
   - Add scenarios: “High Sales” (B1=5000), “Low Sales” (B1=2000).
   - Show or summarize scenarios.

## Practical Scenario
You have a loan model (principal, rate, term). Use Goal Seek to find the rate for a $500 monthly payment and Scenario Manager to compare terms.

## Practice Tasks
1. Use Goal Seek to find units sold for $10,000 revenue.
2. Create three scenarios for different budget levels.
3. Summarize scenarios in a report.
4. Combine Goal Seek with a formula model.
5. Test Scenario Manager with multiple variables.

## Interview Tip
Interviewers may ask for predictive analysis. Practice Goal Seek and Scenario Manager for quick solutions.
